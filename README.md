# <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:36pt;">Laptop Price Prediction ML Project</span>

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Description:</span>

This project involves the analysis and prediction of laptop prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features such as laptop specifications, including RAM, screen size, storage type, operating system, GPU, and more.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Installation:</span>

1. Install Python 3.10 on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn


## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Usage:</span>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code).
3. Run the provided Python script `laptop_price_prediction.py`.
4. Follow the code comments for step-by-step data preprocessing, analysis, and model training.
5. Explore different machine learning models for price prediction, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Data Preprocessing:</span>

- The code preprocesses the dataset by cleaning and transforming features such as RAM, screen size, storage type, operating system, GPU, etc.
- It handles missing values, converts data types, and creates new features like screen resolution, storage types, etc.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</span>

- Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Generates bar plots for categorical features like manufacturer, OS, GPU brand, etc., against laptop prices.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Model Training and Evaluation:</span>

- Utilizes various machine learning models for price prediction, including Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluates models using R-squared (R2) score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Results:</span>

- Discusses the performance of each model in terms of accuracy and prediction errors.
- Provides insights into feature importance and how they contribute to price prediction.

## <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:24pt;">Future Improvements:</span>

- Suggestions for improving the model's performance, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or trying advanced machine learning techniques.
